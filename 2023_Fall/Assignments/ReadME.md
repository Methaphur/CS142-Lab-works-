This course is essentially a problem solving course, and so there will be lots of problems in the form of assignments and practice problems. Anything you hand in is assumed to be done by you on your own. If you had consulted any resource (including books, Internet, or other people), then please mention that in the work you hand in. Copying from any source without acknowledgement will result in unwanted consequences for everyone! There are no excuses for failure to uphold academic integrity.
